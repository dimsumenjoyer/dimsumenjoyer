## About Me

My name is Victor Van (Chinese name: ÊñáÂèä‰ø°ÔºåVietnamese name: VƒÉn T√≠nÔºâ„ÄÇI am an American-born and raised Sino-Vietnamese student currently finishing up an associate's degree at Northern Essex Community College. Starting fall 2025, I will attend Columbia University for a double major in Mathematics and Physics, and a minor in East Asian Studies. This summer, I will be apart of a research project at Merrimack College learning about differential geometry and tensor calculus with applications to general relativity. With this knowledge, we will either work on a project on gravitional lensing or Einstein manifolds. I'm looking towards learning proof-based mathematics.

Transfering universities will be quite a transition for me. I am a social person, so feel free to say "hello" to me in-person. I am a FC Barcelona fan. I'd like to learn how to cook and I'd like to have a gym-partner. Recently, I've become more interested in anime - I've been watching Solo Leveling. I also have long COVID, so if you know any interesting research about this topic let me know.
